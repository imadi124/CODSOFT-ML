## 1. Movie Genre Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms
Created a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.Using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

## 2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## 3. SMS spam detection
Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Used techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages.
