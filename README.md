Movie Genre Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project demonstrates a **text classification model** that predicts the **genre of a movie** based on its description. The model uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and a **machine learning classifier (Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes)** to identify genres such as **Drama, Thriller, Comedy, etc.**

---

## 🚀 Features
- Train a model on movie descriptions and their genres  
- Use **TF-IDF** to convert text into numerical vectors  
- Apply a supervised ML classifier for prediction  
- Test the model on **new, unseen movie descriptions**  
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation
